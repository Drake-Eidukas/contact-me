## Basic Information

Hi all! If you're reading this, there's a good chance you're looking for one of the following: 

* My [Linkedin Account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drake-eidukas/).

## Projects

I'll post links to projects that I work on as I slowly start to get into open source more and more. As of now, there's probably only one notable repo I contribute to, but I'm hoping to expand the list this semester :)

* [Basarat](https://github.com/basarat)'s [Typescript Gitbook](https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book) (I know this is just a book and not a codebase, but it's a start!)
* An admittedly nonsensical and silly website I made for my web-dev class (and 2nd or 3rd ever), [The Cloud Factory](https://github.com/Drake-Eidukas/CS-498-RK1-MP1)
* _In progress_: The next website I'm making for my web-dev class, [Name that Pokemon!](https://github.com/Drake-Eidukas/CS-498-RK1-MP2)
* _In progress_: The next browser extension I'm planning to make, [Papier Cloud](https://github.com/Drake-Eidukas/papier-cloud). Basically, I want to make a version of [Papier](https://getpapier.com/), but that syncs across a given Google Chrome account (ie. I want this to sync across my mac and my desktop and whatever else my chrome account is logged into).
* _In progress_: Twilight. More details TBA.
